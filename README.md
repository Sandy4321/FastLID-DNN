# FastLID-DNN
Deep Neural Networks for Fast Automatic Language Identification over Small Language Sets

## To train network:
Change parameters as desired in `train.lua` and `train_job.slurm`, then submit using:
`sbatch train_job.slurm`

## To test network:
Change parameters as desired in `test.lua` and `test_job.slurm`, then submit using:
`sbatch test_job.slurm`
